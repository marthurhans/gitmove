### ⚖️ Licensing & Future Plans

GitMove is currently under active development, and its licensing model is still under legal review.  
The public edition of GitMove will remain open and accessible to developers.  
A future **GitMove Pro** edition may offer premium features for advanced users and teams.

More information will be published here and at [GitMove.com](https://gitmove.com) *(coming soon!)* as development progresses.
